# Logistics Automation System
Logistics Automation System is software designed to simplify and increase the efficiency of logistics processes.

Logistics Automation System is written in Qt (C++) for the Windows platform. SQLite is used as the database.

The system is intended for operators working in logistics departments or logistics companies.

## Usage
Once the project is set up and running, you can perform the following actions:
- Calculation of delivery costs: The system calculates the cost of delivery based on the route and characteristics of the parcel. This feature helps in accurate cost estimation and budgeting.
- Parcel processing: The system enables the processing of parcels, including receiving, sorting, and dispatching. It streamlines the logistics workflow and ensures efficient handling of parcels.
- Parcel search: Users can search for specific parcels using various criteria such as tracking number, sender information, or recipient information. This feature allows for quick and easy retrieval of parcel details.
- Parcel status management: The system allows users to change the status of parcels as they progress through the logistics chain. This feature provides real-time visibility into the movement and status of parcels.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary technologies and libraries specified in the project's [Dependencies](#dependencies).
3. Build a project with Qt Creator using the `LogisticsAutomationSystem/LogisticsAutomationSystem.pro` file.
4. Compile the project with the Desktop compiler MinGW 64bit.
5. Now you can run the program using Qt Creator or `.exe` file.
